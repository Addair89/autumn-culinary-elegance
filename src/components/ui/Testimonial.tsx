      "Jane's attention to customer service is as good as her food. Her initial consultation was very thorough and provided a good baseline for our first menu. Feedback was well received and provided even more customized menus in following months.",

      "We are big fans of Jane's cooking and her service is superb!  Her dinners are widely diverse, very flavorful and tailored to our palates. They have kept us healthy and happy for the past 8 years. Every Sunday she delivers three meals with four generous servings. Each has a main protein dish and two healthy sides.  We highly recommend her work to anyone lucky enough to have her cook for them.",

      "There's nothing two chefs love more than delicious food, whether it's something exotic and gourmet, or old time comfort food favorites. But when we don't have the time or the inclination to shop for ingredients and cook for ourselves and our families, Jane is a godsend! She listened to all our food preferences, was able to honor our gluten free requests and made wonderful suggestions. Both the entrees and side dishes are a food lover's delight with ample portions. Our top faves include Lemon Caper Halibut, Basil Shrimp, Beef Strogonoff, Couscous Salad and Roasted Vegetables. Give Jane a try, you will be spoiled forever!",
